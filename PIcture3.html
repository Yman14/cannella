<h2><font color="white"><b>The jalapeño is the easiest to find and the most often used at local Mexican restaurants.
It is pronounced: hah-lah-pain-yo. Most people think of the jalapeño as being very hot, but it actually varies
from mild to hot depending on how it was grown and how it was prepared. The heat is concentrated in the seeds 
and the veins, so if you want it on the milder end of its scale, remove those parts.<br>
Jalapeños are sold canned, sliced, and pickled. Canned jalapeños may be milder than fresh because they are usually
peeled and the seeds removed. Pickled jalapeños are always hot.</center></h2><br>

</ul>

<center><p><h2><font color="white">Jalapeños are rich in vitamins A and C and potassium. They also have carotene -- an antioxidant that may help fight damage to your cells – as well as folate, vitamin K, and B vitamins. Many of their health benefits come from a compound called capsaicin. That's what makes the peppers spicy.</h2></p><br><br><br><br>
