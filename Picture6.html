<h2><font color="white"><b>Star anise grows as dark brown pods with eight segments, each containing a pea-sized seed.
	This spice hails from an evergreen tree plant that is native to southern China and northeast Vietnam, although it
	is cultivated in countries like Laos, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines.<br>
Star anise tastes much like a standard anise seed, but slightly more bitter, which is why some chefs use it to provide
 a licorice flavor for some dishes.Anise seed is used more in Western dishes, particularly in Greek and French cuisine,
 since it has an intense, aromatic flavor that's good for sauces. On the other hand, star anise is more common in Asian cooking.</center></h2><br>
