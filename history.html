<br>HISTORY OF THE COMPANY<br><br><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="white">Cannela was born out of the owner's love for cooking. From an early age of 11, he adapted his grandmother's love for cooking. He realized later on that he can also grow his own spices in their backyard.</p>
<p>This interest has grown to a beautiful love story not only with cooking but also with more travels in the future, like Italy, Spain, Greece and Mexico. He comes back home every time with tales of stories. And guess what else...spices!</p></h2>
